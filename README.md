# ProjectHRE

This project aimed at obtaining an estimation for the heart rate (Heart Rate Estimation) after conducting an analysis on data contained in the files. In particular, we have chosen _center_sternum.txt_ and _4_Chest_sweater.txt_ as the datasets to be inspected. Then, after preparing the data, we delved into the estimation part by studying the behaviour of the signals in the time and frequency domain, creating filters to reduce noise and finally obtaining an estimation on the filtered signals. 

The project has been divided into parts, assigned as follows:
- __Data preparation__, by Matteo Andriolo
- __Time and frequency analysis__, by Enrico Gottardis
- __Filters__, by Ledia Pampagnin
- __Metrics__, by Elisa Borella
- __Conclusion__, by the whole team

It is important to stress that as each part was needed in order to proceed with the project, each section has been debugged and revised by all the members of the team, thus creating a project report which is consistent. It was only thanks to the contribution of each member of the team that we were able to obtain such a final report.
In the report there can also be seen observations made on the results obtained and many graphs, which are of great help in visually retrieving information about what is being done.
